Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling two dice. 
When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6 for each die. The program 
will print what that numbers are. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this 
project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, 
that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs 
numbers within that range and prints them.

Concepts to keep in mind:
•	Random
•	Integer
•	Print
•	While Loops

The program must be written in Python 3.
